                Welcome to Your Path Yoga! I'm Megan, a dedicated yoga instructor passionate about helping you discover and deepen your personal yoga journey.
              </p>
              <p>
                With over a decade of teaching experience, I've developed a unique approach that combines traditional yoga practices with modern sequencing techniques. My goal is to make yoga accessible, enjoyable, and transformative for practitioners of all levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe that yoga is more than just physical exerciseâ€”it's a path to self-discovery, mindfulness, and personal growth. Through my teaching, I aim to create a space where you can explore movement, breath, and meditation in a way that feels authentic to your body and spirit.
              </p>

                My teaching style emphasizes:

                <li>Mindful movement and breath awareness</li>
                <li>Safe alignment and proper form</li>
                <li>Personalized practice development</li>
                <li>Creating a supportive and inclusive environment</li>
                <li>Balancing challenge with accessibility</li>

              I believe that yoga should adapt to the practitioner, not the other way around. Whether you're looking to build strength, increase flexibility, reduce stress, or deepen your spiritual practice, I'm here to guide you on your unique path. My approach combines traditional wisdom with contemporary understanding of movement and mindfulness, creating a practice that's both grounding and transformative.
